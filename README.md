## PSReadLine

One of the best features for the PS CLI experience is the PSReadLine **List PredictionView**. Included profile turns it on by default, but also sets convenient shortcuts for navigation, so you don't have to take off your hand to reach the arrows:

- `Alt+j` - to select next element on the list
- `Alt+k` - to select the previous element on the list

> Doesn't work on macOS ðŸ˜ž.

### Other shortcuts

- `Tab` - expands menu completion, you can navigate it with arrows
- `F2` - switch between _List_*_ and _Inline_ prediction view
- `Shift+Tab` - accept inline suggestion
- `Ctrl+LeftArrow` - navigate word left
- `Ctrl+RightArrow` - navigate word right
- `Alt+Delete` - delete whole command line
